# Product Proposal

## Tap-to-reply
As a replier <br>
I want to tap my reply <br>
So That I don't wreck my car <br>
![Untitled Diagram drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89223947/135508067-8d3da65c-6601-4ce1-83c6-b983bad8e30a.png) <br>
The product gives answer choices for the user to choose from as a response to question texts. There are four options that have differing enthusiasm for positive and negative responses. This allows the user to respond quickly to the question in a less distracting manner. 
#### Process:
The user receives a message, and the four possible response options pop up to be selected. The user can change the response options to what they want or what would fit the tone. The user selects the desired response by tapping one of the four quadrants of responses. 
#### Schematic:

## qwxt
As a txt questioner <br>
I want an actual answer to my question <br>
So That I don't loose my üê∏ 'ing mind <br>

The user recieves a question, with the appropriate answers displayed in an easy to submit form.

#### Process:
The process is similar to tap-to-reply above with the ability to answer questions with a tap. Although, this app will take the choices form the quesiton and present them for selection. This allows the user and end user to be more specific with their selection of replys.
