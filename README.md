# Product Proposal

## Tap-to-reply
As a replier <br>
I want to tap my reply <br>
So That I don't wreck my car <br>

The product gives answer choices for the user to choose from as a response to question texts. There are four options that have differing enthusiasm for positive and negative responses. This allows the user to respond quickly to the question in a less distracting manner. 
#### Process:
The user receives a message, and the four possible response options pop up to be selected. The user can change the response options to what they want or what would fit the tone. The user selects the desired response by tapping one of the four quadrants of responses.
