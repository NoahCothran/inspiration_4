# Product Proposal

### Background & Inspiration
* Text replacement on iPhone: This feature will split acronyms (e.g. omw) into words (e.g. on my way). This feature makes typing certain things faster, but does not really 
'itch the scratch' that we want it to. We want something more powerful.
* Predictive text: This feature tries to predict and gives options what the user might want to type next. This feature is sometimes helpful, but it isn't too helpful 
and we want to make replying much faster and easier.


## Tap-to-reply
**As a** replier <br>
**I want to** tap my reply <br>
**So That** I don't wreck my car <br>

The product gives answer choices for the user to choose from as a response to question texts. There are four options that have differing enthusiasm for positive and negative responses. This allows the user to respond quickly to the question in a less distracting manner. 
#### Process:
##### Old way:
1. Recieve a text message
2. Tap on reply box
3. Manually type out the response while trying not to make typos.
##### New way:
1. The user receives a message 
2. The four possible response options pop up to be selected. (The user can change the response options to what they want or what would fit the tone.) 
3. The user selects the desired response by tapping one of the four quadrants of responses. 
#### Schematic:

#### Process:
##### Old way: 
1. *Person A* sends a question that requires one of at least two different options to *Person B*.
2. *Person B* replies "yes", which does not answer the question and annoys *Person A* greatly.
##### New way:
1. *Person A* sends a question that requires one of at least two different options to *Person B*.
2. The app will find the multiple options and will give only the correct possible responses to *Person B*.
3. *Person B* taps on one of the response options and properly replies to *Person A*'s liking.
